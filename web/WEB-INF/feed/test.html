                            <h4 class="description">It was recorded between October 2014 and April 2015 at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver,
                                British Columbia, and co-produced by the band and Robert John "Mutt" Lange. Muse aimed to return
                                to the simpler guitar-bass-drums rock sound of their earlier albums.
                                Drones is a concept album following the protagonist's journey from abandonment to indoctrination
                                as a "human drone" and eventual defection. Drones received mixed to positive reviews from
                                critics, who praised the music but criticised the lyrics. The album won the Grammy Award for
                                Best Rock Album at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards.
                                On their previous albums The Resistance (2009) and The 2nd Law (2012), Muse incorporated
                                orchestral and electronic music. In December 2013, Muse released a live album and video,
                                Live at Rome Olympic Stadium; songwriter Matt Bellamy said the band wanted the live album "to
                                capture some of the extremes of what we've been doing since we want to go in a different
                                direction in the future."

                    <h4>Recording of the album took place in four different studios, began in October 2011, and ended in
                        August 2012. Mainly self-produced by the band, with the exception of the song "Follow Me" which
                        was
                        co-produced by English electronic music trio Nero, The 2nd Law features multiple styles of music
                        and
                        was influenced by acts such as Queen, David Bowie, and Skrillex.
                        Upon release, the album received generally favourable reviews from music critics and had a very
                        positive commercial performance. It was a top ten-charting album in thirty-one countries and a
                        number one album in thirteen countries. The album has been certified platinum by the BPI in
                        England,
                        the FIMI in Italy, the IFPI in Switzerland, and the MC in Canada. It has also been certified
                        triple-platinum by the SNEP in France. At the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, the album was nominated
                        for
                        Best Rock Album and the album's second track "Madness" was nominated for Best Rock Song. The
                        album's
                        third track "Panic Station" was also nominated for Best Rock Song at the 56th Annual Grammy
                        Awards
                        the following year.
